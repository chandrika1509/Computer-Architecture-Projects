Assignment 1 : 

Write a C program running on Linux to access (read, write) memory in different pattern (linear, random),
and measure the average access time of L1, L2, L3 cache and main memory.

Describe your method and report your data in tables and diagrams. 
Then answer the following question.
(a) Is this average access time represents the latency or throughput of memory hierarchy? Why? How did
you mitigate the overhead in measurement, or how did you improve the accuracy of your measurement?
(b) What makes the access time different for linear access pattern and random access pattern? Is there
difference for read and write? Why?
